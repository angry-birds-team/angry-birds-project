This code snippet is a comprehensive script designed for video processing, utilizing libraries such as OpenCV for video manipulation, TensorFlow Lite for running a pre-trained model, OpenPyXL for writing outputs to an Excel workbook, and Tkinter for basic GUI elements. The code aims to analyze video frames, detect objects with a certain confidence level, and record timestamps of these detections into an Excel file. Here's a short review covering its main aspects:

Design and Functionality:
Environment Configuration: Sets an environment variable for FFMPEG read attempts, likely to ensure robust video processing.
