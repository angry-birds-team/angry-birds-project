Summarize what we've done this week.

Informed Rin that we had created a server for our daya and had trained a preliminary model for the wrens which we would be testing soon. Informed her we would be starting on a GUI soon. 

Ask if she has any questions.

Rin asked about how we had trained the model and how our program worked. She asked if the program could be run on multiple computers at a time. (Told her yes.) She asked if multiple files could be fed into the machine in sequence. (Told her this logic was not implemented, but that I would add it to our features list.) She asked if we could maintain a list of the resources we used. (I said I would get such a list started.)

Questions for Rin:

Were you wanting our software to detect baby birds?

No, that is not necessary currently. 

Will the software ever need to detect wrens and warblers in the same footage?

No.

What level of speed are you expecting?

She would prefer if it took less time, but it should be alright if it can run in the background.

Do you need an output video or just the excel file? 

The excel is mostly what is necessary, but she would like a video interface if possible.

How long should the gap be before we start a new trip? 

She would prefer to have duplicates than to miss trips, so do not add logic for ignoring gaps.

Arrange next meeting.

Next Meeting April 5 at 1pm. 

Notes:

Videos are taken on brood day 4 or 7.

Cowbirds may appear as nest parasites.
