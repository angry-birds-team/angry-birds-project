Feedback from Tamia Boston: 
The GUI looks good so far! 
I enjoyed clicking around and testing the processing button and see how changing the frame speed affected the program. 
If I had to point out anything, just don't forget to add some comments explaining the different features so that any future people reading the code doesn't get confused. 
Besides that, looks like you're on track.
