Received Feedback from TA (Israt Naiyer):

She noted that we had previously said that we were using placeholder data to test our program.

She recommended we move to using real data as quickly as possible. (We are in now in the process of doing so.)

I spoke with her about the process we had been using to train our new model. (Training from a premade  model on Google colab with code with sourced from someone else.)

I noted that we didn't have as many training images as we liked, especially as far as variety goes. She advised that homogeneity will probably not be a problem given the data set we are expected to handle.

I informed her that we had not yet started on a GUI, and She recommended we get start on one as quickly as possible.


Feedback Given:

I was not able to find someone who needed feedback. I spoke with Prof. Cook and she informed me that this was alright.
