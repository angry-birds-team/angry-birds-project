The following review is a code review of the main.py file. The file could benefit from error
handling or exceptions to avoid any potential crashes, but apart from this possible improvement,
the code is very legible and organized. There are comments throughout the code to help clarify
what is going on. The variable names are kept simple and easy to identify, and there are an
appropriate amount of indentations. Global and local variables are used appropriately.
