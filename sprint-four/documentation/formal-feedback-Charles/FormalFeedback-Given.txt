Feedback To Tamia Boston: 

Overall, I found it to be well-designed and user-friendly. 
The interface was intuitive, and I was able to fill in all the required information without encountering any errors or crashes, which made the process very smooth. 
However, I did encounter an issue with the pictures on the website. 
For some reason, they either wouldn't load or appeared blank. 
I hope this feedback is helpful, and I look forward to seeing the issue resolved. 
Keep up the great work with the rest of the website!
