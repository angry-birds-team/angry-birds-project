Feedback Given to Naitik Kaythwal (Tag Team):

I conducted a user test of the Tag Team's application for TA's. 

I found that the application worked well in general

I noticed a bug where a student's average was not calculated.

I thought that it was confusing that only bad grades were color coded and suggested the good grades be color coded in green.

I thought some of the grade boxes could use better visual seperation.

I thought the sprints should be linked on the progress screen, but I thought the visual indicatators of missing survery, missing feedback, etc., where well designed and clear.
