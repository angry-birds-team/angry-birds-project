Received Feedback from Naitik Kaythwal (Tag Team):


Naitik user tested our application. I had him load up a file and run through it with the object detection algorithm. 

He noted that when a file is loaded, the gui still displays "Video Not Found". He found this confusing and suggested it be replaced with a frame from the video.

He also noted that when loading a second video after the first, it didn't load properly for some reason. There is some sort of bug.
